### **Key Features**
1. **Driver and Constructor Info**
   - Activities such as `DriverinfoActivity` and `ConstructorinfoActivity` suggest that the app provides detailed information about F1 drivers and teams.
   
2. **Race Details**
   - Activities like `PastRaceInfosActivity` and `UpcomingRaceInfosActivity` indicate functionality for displaying schedules, results, and other race details.
   - Fragments like `UpcomingRaceScheduleFragment` and `PastRaceCircuitFragment` support segmented viewing of race details.

3. **Standings and Statistics**
   - Fragments such as `DriversStandingFragment` and `ConstructorStandingFragment` likely display the championship standings.
   - Adapters like `StandingDriversAdapter` and `StandingConstructorAdapter` manage how standings are shown in a list format.

4. **Animations and UI**
   - Animations (e.g., fade in, slide in/out) and custom layouts suggest an interactive and visually appealing interface.
   - Includes custom fonts (e.g., `formula1_black.ttf`) to match the F1 branding.

5. **Multilingual Support**
   - Presence of `values-fr/strings.xml` indicates French language support.

6. **Data Handling**
   - Files like `data_2021.kt` and `data_2024.kt` suggest preloaded or sample F1 data for specific seasons.
